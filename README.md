**What is a Zestimate?**
A Zestimate is Zillow’s estimated market value for a home, computed using a proprietary formula including public and user-submitted data. Updating your home facts can help make your Zestimate more accurate. A Zestimate is not an official appraisal, but is a starting point in determining a home’s value.
